Hi, I'm Nick DeSteffen. I live in Chicago, Illinois and I've been a software engineer for for over 15 years.
I started out programming in Java/J2EE and moved into Ruby / Rails about 12 years ago.

I am currently working at [BenchPrep](https://benchprep.com){:target="_blank"} as Lead Software Engineer.

Previously I was a co-founder and Lead Developer at WisePatient, which was acquired by [Sharecare Inc.](https://www.sharecare.com/){:target="_blank"} in early 2012.

Some of my hobbies include Camping & Hiking, Astronomy, Board Games, Biking, Computer Gaming, Homebrewing, Gardening, and Woodworking.
