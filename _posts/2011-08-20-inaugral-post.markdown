Welcome to my blog. I've been telling myself that I should create one for the past couple of years, it seems that every project I work on I end up with some bits of information that I think might be useful to others.

I built this blog using the latest version of [Ruby on Rails (3.1)](http://rubyonrails.org/){:target="_blank"} and it is hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com){:target="_blank"}. I also wrote all the CSS myself, I consider myself mostly a backend programmer, I've written CSS parts of sites before, but never the entire stylesheet until now.

In case anybody is interested, you are more than welcome to take a look at the [source code](http://github.com/nick-desteffen/personal_website){:target="_blank"}.

Hopefully [Eight Bit Studios](http://eightbitstudios.com){:target="_blank"} will continue to have interesting projects and I'll have some useful topics to post about.
